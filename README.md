Calendar
========

## Requirements

* Use the same markup for mobile & desktop
* You can presume your app is as powerful as you need it to be, i.e. it can output a class based on any logic that you need.

## On mobile:

* List view, only showing days with events
* Show month, date & day-of-week
* Show title & time
* Show location
* Show description
* Show category tag (e.g. “Kids”)

## On desktop:

* Calendar view should look like a calendar
* Just show date
* Show category with color, not tag
* Show title & time
* No location
* No description
* “More link”, when clicked, show description
* Show week headers

## And here's an example event:

*Storytime [KIDS]*  
11 - 11:30 AM • Library  
During storytime we'll explore awesome stories, songs, hands-on activities.
